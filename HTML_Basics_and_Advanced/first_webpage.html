While we all know cheetahs are extreamly fast, they can go up to 50-80 mph making them one of the fastes land animal, their speed is caused by a combination of anatomical and physiological aadaptations specifically desinged for speed and agility. Cheetahs have an amazing vision, the sun doesn't affect their eyes that much thanks to their "tear lines" on bot sides of their nose. Cheetahs are large cats with unique sounds, Cheetas make various chirps, purrs, and hgih-pitched calls for communication, but cheetahs do not roar, which makes them look more like a cat than a thing that can kill you. Cheetahs are endangered species, there is less than 7,500 cheetahs left in the wild in Africa.  </p>
